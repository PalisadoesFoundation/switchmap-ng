            ## Our Pull Request Approval Process

            We have these basic policies to make the approval process smoother for our volunteer team.

            ### Testing Your Code

            Please make sure your code passes all tests. Our test code coverage system will fail if either of these two conditions occur:

            1.  The overall code coverage drops below the target threshold of the repository
            2.  Any file in the pull request has code coverage levels below the repository threshold

            The process helps maintain the overall reliability of the code base and is a prerequisite for getting your PR approved. Assigned reviewers regularly review the PR queue and tend to focus on PRs that are passing.

            ### Reviewers

            When your PR has been assigned reviewers contact them to get your code reviewed and approved via:

            1. comments in this PR or
            1. our slack channel

            #### Reviewing Your Code

            Your reviewer(s) will have the following roles:

            1.  arbitrators of future discussions with other contributors about the validity of your changes
            2.  point of contact for evaluating the validity of your work
            3.  person who verifies matching issues by others that should be closed.
            4.  person who gives general guidance in fixing your tests

            :dart: Contacting the person who assigned the mentors is not advised unless they make a request. Do not @ the person who did the assignment otherwise.
