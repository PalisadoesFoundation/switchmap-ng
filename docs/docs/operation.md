# Advanced Operation

The `switchmap-ng` CLI is meant for ease of use. This page shows some
advanced features.

## Running Switchmap Processes as System Daemons

All the switchmap daemon executables can be configured to run at the
system level using systemd. This means that they will reliably restart
after a reboot. This is therefore the preferred mode of operation for
production systems.

1)  Sample `systemd` files can be found in the `examples/linux/systemd/`
    directory.
2)  Each file contains instructions as to what to do

### Operating the Poller as a System Daemon

The `poller` can be started like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl start switchmap_poller.service
```

The `poller` can be stopped like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl stop switchmap_poller.service
```

You can get the status of the `poller` like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl status switchmap_poller.service
```

You can get the `poller` to automatically restart on boot like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl enable switchmap_poller.service
```

### Operating the API server as a System Daemon

The `server` can be started like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl start switchmap_server.service
```

The `server` can be stopped like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl stop switchmap_server.service
```

You can get the status of the `server` like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl status switchmap_server.service
```

You can get the `server` to automatically restart on boot like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl enable switchmap_server.service
```

### Operating the Ingester as a System Daemon

The `ingester` can be started like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl start switchmap_ingester.service
```

The `ingester` can be stopped like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl stop switchmap_ingester.service
```

You can get the status of the `ingester` like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl status switchmap_ingester.service
```

You can get the `ingester` to automatically restart on boot like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl enable switchmap_ingester.service
```

### Operating the Dashboard as a System Daemon

The `dashboard` can be started like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl start switchmap_dashboard.service
```

The `dashboard` can be stopped like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl stop switchmap_dashboard.service
```

You can get the status of the `dashboard` like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl status switchmap_dashboard.service
```

You can get the `dashboard` to automatically restart on boot like this:

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl enable switchmap_dashboard.service
```
